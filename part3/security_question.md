## Security Considerations for Solar Panel Installation App

**Context**

System security is a critical aspect of any software application. It is especially important for applications 
that handle sensitive user data, such as passwords, credit card information, and home addresses. 
Using the OWASP Top 10 as reference, here are some security considerations for the solar panel installation app.

**Recommendations**

1. **Broken Access Control**

    * Implement proper access control mechanisms, such as role-based access control (RBAC) in order to ensure
   that the data is accessed without endangering the users.
    * Implement strong password policies and enforce multi-factor authentication for all user accounts.

2. **Cryptographic Failures**

    * Encrypt sensitive data, such as passwords and credit card information.
    * Use secure hashing algorithms for password storage and verification.
    * Implement secure key management practices to protect encryption keys. Keys should not be hard-coded or stored in easily accessible locations.

3. **Injection**

    * Sanitize all user input to prevent injection attacks, including SQL injection, command injection, and cross-site scripting (XSS).
    * Use parameterized queries and prepared statements with the database to avoid SQL injection vulnerabilities.
    * Validate and escape all user-supplied data before rendering it in the application.

4. **Insecure Design**

    * Implement security throughout the software development lifecycle (SDLC) for new developments,
   from design to deployment.
    * Conduct regular risk assessments to identify potential security flaws.
    * Follow secure coding practices and design patterns to minimize vulnerabilities.

5. **Security Misconfiguration**

    * Use same security configurations in all environments, including development, testing, and production.
    * Implement a vulnerability management process to identify and remediate vulnerabilities promptly.
    * Review cloud service provider (CSP) configurations to ensure that they are secure.

6. **Vulnerable and Outdated Components**

    * Maintain an up-to-date inventory of all software components used in the system.
    * Regularly update software components to the latest secure versions.
    * Regularly perform dependency scanning to identify and address vulnerabilities in dependencies.
